About Me/Details:

Some details about me and my background and what my vision is for the mod--

I have a small background in IT and programming but I am still a complete novice. 
I decided that github would be a good place to store this, 
my notes, and get feedback and allow others to use my code if it suits their needs. 

I am competely open to advice or want for collaboration. 

I do work a fulltime job and a social life so this will more be a side project and not something to be worked on Full time. 
Anyone is open to picking up parts of the project to help the progress and development of the mod, just be sure to ask
me first so we can properly collaborate. 

Anyone that contributes in a significant manner will be credited as I develop this mod. 

Why did I want to create this?

   - I wanted to recreate something I love in a game I love just as much. Being a Naruto fan since I could remember watching it on saturday night TV at night,
it left a huge impact on me and my life. I did some digging and couldn't find a single mode for a proper anime adaptation for this despite there being
plenty of anime mods that just convert the pictures and texts used but nothing deeper. I want this to be the first deep dive total conversion mod
for anime fans or even people who want something different not based on a real events or something fresh to the community. 

How long will this project take to finish?

  - It could take months if not years to complete if I keep the drive to create and if it starts to gain support. I am hopeful some HOI4 fans will see this as a fresh change 
of pace as I want this to be a mod anyone can play, not just fans of the show. This is a tall order and it will take time to break it down into bite size pieces I can handle.
 
Why Naruto?

  - Like I said before, I remember watching Naruto as a child. It's stuck with me all the way into my adult years, and now I want to create something for it. 

Am I worried about copyright?

  - I believe if there can be a My little pony, Lord of the rings, and Game of Thrones mod, there can be a Naruto shippuden mod.
